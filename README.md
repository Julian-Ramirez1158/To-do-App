This project serves as a basic to-do React app that can remind users what items they have left to pack for an upcoming trip. This single page app consists of a product title as well as a brief set of instructions that prompt the user to enter new list items in the text input field. Once the user submits a piece of text, that data is rendered as a list item on the app. The user can then check off each individual list item until they have completed their packing list. The technologies used in this project are HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, and React.  The site can improve by integrating more sophisticated Javascript logic, adding one or two more HTML pages offering different content, and elevating the general styling of the page.
